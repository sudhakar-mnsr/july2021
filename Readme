Plan Methodology
Plans are generated with strict guidelines. Always the dates are fixed after reviewing what are tasks (sources) and what are deliverables from these tasks. E.g If a source has demos then we need to analyse the feasibility of the demos and give estimates.
follow ups and prerequisites need to be finalized here itself. This results in estimates to be correct and smooth preparation with no backforth.

Identify the tasks
Identify the sources for the tasks (how to prepare and where you have this information)
Evaluate the sources (Add prerequisites, complexity) (How to cover the syllabus)
Identify questions and how to get solutions
Finalize the deliverables
Questions and posts are deliverables
Add estimates
